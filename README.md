## Specification

As part of the task, a data collection and data processing system must be designed and prepared, which is capable of real-time collection, preprocessing and delivery of data from industrial equipment to a central system, where the data can be analyzed and displayed on different dashboards.

The specific goal of the task is to be able to collect and display real-time data from the machine tool (lathe) located in one of the workshops of the GTT department (faculty of mechanical engineering, building G) in the Technology Center of Ipar4 (building I, no. 017.)

Tasks to be completed (can be divided between students, it is not necessary for everyone to complete all tasks):
· separation and testing of sensors, writing associated data collection and preprocessing program modules;
· testing microcontrollers, selecting the task (Raspberry PI, ESP32, ESP8285, ESP8266, Arduino, etc.);
· designing the data collection system (hw, sw, mechanical elements);
· mechanical and electrical assembly of the data collection system (3D printed parts can be used);
· writing the software of the data collection system (collecting and issuing data with MQTT / HTTP / OPC-UA protocol), testing it (in the language depending on the selected microcontroller)
· planning and creating the data analysis and display backend application and frontend interface (in a freely chosen programming language);

During the work, the students gain useful experience in the field of industrial data collection and data processing, as well as get to know our partner companies, where they can test and try out the designed data collection tool.
